# Handwritten Digit classification using CNN

Handwritten Digit classification using MNIST dataset. MNIST is a dataset of 60,000 training set images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9, each image is a 28x28 pixel square. This code classifies a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9 using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
